This is my personal website. Iâ€™m currently finishing up my fourth year at UCLA, studying economics with a math minor.

This website is still under development. I plan to start blogging on various data science topics when I have more time in the spring.
This website is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and uses a template from [Steven Miller](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template).
