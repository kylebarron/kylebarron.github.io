I am a Research Assistant for MIT Economics professor [Joseph Doyle](http://www.mit.edu/~jjdoyle/). I have academic interests spanning urban economics, environmental economics, and the impact of new technologies.

Prior to this position, I completed my B.A. in Economics at UCLA, graduating in Spring 2017. While there, I conducted research for [Matthew Kahn](https://sites.google.com/site/mek1966/) and [Adriana Lleras-Muney](http://economics.ucla.edu/person/adriana-lleras-muney/). 

This website is open source: the files to create this are held in [Github repository](https://github.com/kylebarron/kylebarron.github.io). The site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and is based off of a template from [Steven Miller](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template).
