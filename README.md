============

This is my personal/academic website as hosted on Github at [kylebarron.github.io](https://kylebarron.github.io) and powered by Jekyll.

This repository will also serve as my most up-to-date Jekyll theme as well. This template mostly comes from [svmiller's](https://github.com/svmiller/svmiller.github.io) excellent website.
