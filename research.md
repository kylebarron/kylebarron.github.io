My research focuses on international conflict, particularly over the distribution of territory. I examine the effect these territorial issues have on domestic politics, particularly at the level of the individual citizen. Here, you can find materials relevant to my published research and research in progress. 

I also provide titles for some working papers and works in progress below. I provide full links for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in some of these projects. [My CV](http://svmiller.com/cv/) contains more information about where some of these projects are in the peer review process.
