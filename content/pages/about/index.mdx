From 2021 to December 2022 I was a Staff Software Engineer at [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com), building out Foursquare Studio, a
platform for browser-based geospatial analytics.

From 2020 to 2021 I worked at [Unfolded](https://unfolded.ai) until its acquisition by Foursquare. I
developed technology for client-side, GPU-accelerated, high bit-depth raster data rendering; wrote
Python SDKs to interface with the Unfolded Cloud; and wrote JavaScript implementations of decoding
several geospatial data formats.

From 2017 to 2019 I was a Research Assistant for MIT Sloan School of Management
professor [Joseph Doyle](http://www.mit.edu/~jjdoyle/). I developed tools to
better analyze large healthcare data, wrote reports, and helped plan randomized
controlled trials of healthcare evaluations.

I completed my B.A. in Economics with a Minor in Mathematics at UCLA, graduating
in Spring 2017 with Departmental High Honors and Magna Cum Laude. While there, I
conducted research for [Matthew Kahn](https://sites.google.com/site/mek1966/)
and [Adriana
Lleras-Muney](http://economics.ucla.edu/person/adriana-lleras-muney/).
