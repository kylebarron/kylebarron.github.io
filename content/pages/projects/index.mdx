I love to explore and build new things. I've recently been focused on projects
to support reproducible web-based mapping. The source for nearly all my projects
is available at [Github](https://github.com/kylebarron).

<Title text="Mapping" />

##### [National Scenic Trails Guide](projects/nst-guide)

Hello world

##### [OSM Liberty Topo](projects/osm-liberty-topo)

Hello world

##### `demquery`

##### `keplergl_quickvis`

<GithubLink
  languages={["py"]}
  href="https://github.com/kylebarron/keplergl_quickvis"
/>

Python library and command line interface to quickly, interactively visualize
geospatial data with [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/). Since I work with GIS data
in Python, I use this whenever I need to see my data on a map.

<Title text="Jupyter" />

##### Stata Jupyter Kernel

<GithubLink
  languages={["py"]}
  href="https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel"
/>

Connects the [Stata](https://stata.com) statistical package to the
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) ecosystem, enabling researchers to use a modern
data science toolkit with Stata.

Jupyter Notebooks permit sharing of code and results together, with simple
reproducible modifications in a web-based computational environment. Alternative
front-ends like [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen) allow for rich
HTML output even from computations on a remote server.

As of February 2020, it has been downloaded [nearly 90,000 times](https://pepy.tech/project/stata-kernel).

##### Hydrogen

<GithubLink languages={["js"]} href="https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen" />

The Hydrogen project is a front-end for the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
project, enabling interactive coding and rich output formats inside the Atom
text editor. I [contributed
code](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/commits?author=kylebarron) that
allowed Jupyter Notebook files to be imported and exported as regular Python
files.

<Title text="Stata" />

While working as an economics research assistant, I built a number of
open-source tools that interface with the [Stata statistical
package](https://stata.com) to improve research reproducibility and increase
productivity.

##### `stata-exec`

<GithubLink
  languages={["js"]}
  href="https://github.com/kylebarron/stata-exec"
/>

Send code to the Stata window from the Atom text editor. This is a more
primitive version of running Stata code from Atom than the Jupyter kernel above.

##### `language-stata`

<GithubLink
  languages={["py"]}
  href="https://github.com/kylebarron/language-stata"
/>

Syntax highlighting for Stata for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io).

##### `stataParquet`

<GithubLink
  languages={["java"]}
  href="https://github.com/kylebarron/stataParquet"
/>

A prototype Java implementation of reading [Parquet
files](https://parquet.apache.org/) into Stata. My first Java project, I was
able to successfully read Parquet files into Stata's memory, but it ended up
being less performant than my friend Mauricio Caceres' [C++
implementation](https://github.com/mcaceresb/stata-parquet).

<Title text="Miscellaneous" />

##### `medicare-documentation`

<GithubLink
  languages={["py"]}
  href="https://github.com/kylebarron/medicare-documentation/"
/>

While working with Medicare data, I was frustrated with the fragmented state of public documentation regarding the data I was working with.

I
[scraped](https://github.com/kylebarron/medicare-documentation/blob/master/code/02parse.py)
the [ResDAC documentation website](https://www.resdac.org/) and joined it with
[public NBER documentation](https://data.nber.org/medicare/) to create my own
beautiful, responsive [documentation
website](https://kylebarron.dev/medicare-documentation) to help me search
documentation faster. I used [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) as the static
site generator and [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) as the theming.
