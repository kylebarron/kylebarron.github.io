I love to explore and build new things. I've recently been focused on projects
to support reproducible web-based mapping. The source for nearly all my projects
is available at [Github](https://github.com/kylebarron).

### Mapping

#### [National Scenic Trails Guide](projects/nst-guide)

Hello world

#### [OSM Liberty Topo](projects/osm-liberty-topo)

Hello world

#### `demquery`

#### `keplergl_quickvis`

<GithubLink
  languages={["py"]}
  href="https://github.com/kylebarron/keplergl_quickvis"
/>

Python library and command line interface to quickly, interactively visualize
geospatial data with [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/). Since I work with GIS data
in Python, I use this whenever I need to see my data on a map.

### Jupyter

#### Hydrogen

The Hydrogen project.
I [contributed code](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/commits?author=kylebarron) that allowed Jupyter Notebook files to be imported and exported as regular Python files.

### Stata

While working as a research assistant for an economist, I built a number of
open-source tools that interface with the [Stata statistical
package](https://stata.com) to improve research reproducibility and increase
productivity.

#### Stata Jupyter Kernel

<GithubLink
  languages={["py"]}
  href="https://github.com/kylebarron/stata_kernel"
/>

Connects Stata to the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) ecosystem, enabling researchers to use a modern data science toolkit with Stata.

Jupyter Notebooks permit sharing of code and results together, with simple
reproducible modifications in a web-based computational environment. Alternative
front ends like [Hydrogen](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen) allow for rich
HTML output even from computations on a remote server.

As of February 2020, it has been downloaded [nearly 90,000 times](https://pepy.tech/project/stata-kernel).

#### `language-stata`

Syntax highlighting for Stata for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io).
