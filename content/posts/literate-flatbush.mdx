title: "Literate Flatbush: Understanding a fast, elegant RTree implementation."
date: 2025-01-08
# Note: Originally I tried to set this directly to literate-flatbush. But because gatsby intercepts links to try and make it feel more like an "instant application", the URL in the search bar would change to kylebarron.dev/literate-flatbush, but then we'd still be on this blog page. And we wouldn't be able to reload the page and get to the real literate-flatbush post.
slug: /blog/literate-flatbush

Spatial indexes, and RTrees specifically, are at the core of geospatial software engineering.

_But ever wondered how an RTree is actually implemented?_

In this post we'll dive into the implementation of Flatbush, a blazing-fast, memory-efficient RTree.

Because the post uses a different theme, it is hosted _directly_ by Github pages at (<a href="https://kylebarron.dev/literate-flatbush/">https://kylebarron.dev/literate-flatbush/</a>), and embedded below:
