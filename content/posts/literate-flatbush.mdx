Spatial indexes, and RTrees specifically, are at the core of geospatial software engineering.

_But ever wondered how an RTree is actually implemented?_

In this post we'll dive into the implementation of Flatbush, a blazing-fast, memory-efficient RTree.

Because the post uses a different theme, it is hosted _directly_ by Github pages at ([https://kylebarron.dev/literate-flatbush/](https://kylebarron.dev/literate-flatbush/)), and embedded below:
