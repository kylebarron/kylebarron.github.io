After a few years of having a semi-dead [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based website, I'm happy to transition to a new website based on [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

I'm excited for this switch because I can incorporate some cool new technologies
into the site. For example, [this post][this_post] is written in [_MDX_][mdx],
which allows you to combine the simplicity of Markdown with the flexibility of
React.

For example, I can have editable code snippets that accept updates from the user, like this:
```js react-live
const onClick = () => {
  alert("Change this text");
};
render(<button onClick={onClick}>Click me!</button>);
```
Update `Change this text`, click the button, and you can see the text you just
put in!

I'm using [this starter][gatsby_starter], which helped to get everything set up.
The website is hosted on Github Pages, and builds and deploys automatically on
every new commit using Travis CI, so I can just write and commit! Everything is
open source at <https://github.com/kylebarron/kylebarron.github.io>.
