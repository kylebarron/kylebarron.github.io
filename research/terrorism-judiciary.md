## Abstract

Independent judiciaries serve as important stopgaps against democratic reversals and can help facilitate peaceful transitions of power essential to democratic survival. An independent judiciary is an important institution that legitimates democracy among citizens. What, then, explains legitimacy of an independent judiciary itself? Past scholarship argues citizens lose faith in an independent judiciary when the judiciary is corrupt or when it fails to deliver procedural fairness in legal matters. I argue that citizens living under conditions of high terror threat lose confidence in independent judiciaries even when the judiciary is honest and fair. Terror threats lead citizens to enable the state leader to provide for their security and defeat the source of terrorism. These have important implications for inter-branch relations between the executive branch and the judicial branch. As a result, citizens living under terror threats lose confidence in independent judiciaries that provide due process for suspected terrorists. I test my argument with a mixed effects models that incorporate the Global Terrorism Database and four waves of European Values Survey. The analyses demonstrate the negative effects of terror threats on judicial confidence when interacting terror threats with measures of judicial independence. My findings have important implications for the study of democratic confidence and the liberty-security dilemma.
