I normally teach a Tuesday-Thursday schedule each semester and have office hours Wednesday morning from 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. I also tend to be available in my office before or shortly after my classes on Tuesday and Thursday. Students are welcome to use the following app to let me know when I can expect them.

My office is 230A Brackett Hall. Office hours are by e-mail appointment only in the summer.
