<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research and the classes that I teach. Iâ€™m currently an assistant professor in the <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/cbbs/departments/political-science/">Department of Political Science</a> at <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/">Clemson University</a>.</p>
	<p>My research and teaching interests include international conflict, democratic peace and conflict behavior, and political behavior. In particular, my current research agenda focuses on changes in individual-level attitudes and political behavior as part of the conflict process linking salient issues in the international system to militarized conflict. My research appears in journals like <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>, <em>Conflict Management and Peace Science</em>, <em>International Studies Quarterly</em>, <em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em>, <em>Journal of Peace Research</em>, <em>Political Behavior</em>, and <em>Social Science Quarterly</em>.</p>
